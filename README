There are two usage modes for CombiSAT:

(1) Stand alone SAT solver:
./combisat -s <solver1> -s <solver2> ... -s <solvern> <formula file>
where <solverk> are paths to the executables of individual solvers (e.g. ./minisat, ./precosat, ./clasp) that support DIMACS input.

(2) SAT formula server:
./satserver -s <solver1> -s <solver2> .... [-b]

In this case, the -b parameter specifies that the portfolio should run in batch mode, where all the solvers are waited for to finish, in order to evaluate their performace.
